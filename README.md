# Prediction of loan eligibility using machine learing
# Aim
To predict wether person eligible  for loan or not
# objective
To check whether the person can get the loan or not by evaluating the data with the help of decision tree classifiers which can gives the accurate result for the prediction.
# Methodology
**Data Collection:-** We worked on Secondary Data, Secondary data collected  from kaggel.

**Data infromation**

**Data CLeaning:-** Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors.The dataset consists of many null values which will affect the accuracy of the model during prediction. If numeric  data have null value then replace with mean  and if  categorical data have null value then replace with mode.
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** In exploratory Data Analysis we are explor data and find the relation between variables and  also visualize graph .
**Algorithms:-** We use machine learning algorithm.
1 Classification 
2 Logistic Regression
3 Decision Tree
4 Random Forest
